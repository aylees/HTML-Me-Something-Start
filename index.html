                 <p><strong>Vibes Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>
                 <p><strong>Coffee Rating:</strong> 1/5</p>
                 <p>Pros: A multi-story, reasonably priced cafe with food and drinks (the tea and cakes are wonderful).
                     Check Grow is open late and close to a subway station, making it easy to visit. 
                     It's so easy to study or read here, and they do have 'quiet areas'.
                      The views are great; you can see across the river. </p>
                 <p>Cons: The coffee is super watery, and the food is just okay, 
                    but a lot of people stop by the convenience store to grab some snacks. 
                    The weekends can get busy, especially if there is an event going on downtown.  </p>

                 <p><strong>Coffee Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>
                 <p>Pros: Koriko is a Studio Ghibli-themed cafe with a great seasonal selection of drinks and bakery items.
                     All of the staff are very friendly. It's a perfect place to meet with friends.</p>
                 <p>Cons: The wait is almost always an hour plus, and you only have a limited time in the cafe. 
                    However, it's more of an experience and not a study or reading cafe. </p>

                 <p><strong>Coffee Rating:</strong> 5/5</p>
                 <p>Pros: The coffee is some of the best in Seoul, and the cafe is Instagrammable. 
                    Fall in Lemiu decorates according to the seasons and has a whole upstairs area with some interactive art pieces not pictured.
                     They also have another floor dedicated to selling their makeup line, which is pretty unique.</p>
                 <p>Cons: The cafe is a bit far and a little difficult to get to. 
                    The seating is uncomfortable if staying for a long time, but there is a study cafe across the street.</p>
